### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm Sai Sreeya from Bangalore. I graduated in June 2023 and am currently pursuing my master's in Applied Computer Science at Northwest Missouri State University. As tech enthusiast, I'm always eager to explore and learn new things in the vast world of technology.
 
 I might describe myself as a bit dumb, but hey, that's where the fun begins! I'm known for my unique blend of wit and laughter, making every learning experience enjoyable. When I'm not cracking jokes, you can catch me buried in novels, grooving to music, or discovering new places.
